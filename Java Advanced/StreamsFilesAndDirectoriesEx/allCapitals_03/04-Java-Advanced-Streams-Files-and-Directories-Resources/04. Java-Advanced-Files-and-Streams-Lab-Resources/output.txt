ON JANUARY 1 , 1533 , MICHAEL ANGELO, THEN FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS OLD, WRITESFROM FLORENCE TO TOMMASO DE' CAVALIERI, A YOUTH OF NOBLE ROMAN FAMILY,WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME HIS FAVOURITE PUPIL: "IF I DO NOT POSSESS THEART OF NAVIGATING THE SEA OF YOUR POTENT GENIUS, THAT GENIUS WILLNEVERTHELESS EXCUSE ME, AND NEITHER DESPISE MY INEQUALITY, NOR DEMANDOF ME THAT WHICH I HAVE IT NOT IN ME TO GIVE; SINCE THAT WHICH STANDSALONE IN EVERYTHING CAN IN NOTHING FIND ITS COUNTERPART. WHEREFORE YOURLORDSHIP, _THE ONLY LIGHT IN OUR AGE VOUCHSAFED TO THIS WORLDS_ HAVINGNO EQUAL OR PEER, CANNOT FIND SATISFACTION IN THE WORK OF ANY OTHERHAND. IF, THEREFORE, THIS OR THAT IN THE WORKS WHICH I HOPE AND PROMISETO EXECUTE SHOULD HAPPEN TO PLEASE YOU, I SHOULD CALL THAT WORK, NOTGOOD, BUT FORTUNATE. AND IF I SHOULD EVER FEEL ASSURED THAT--AS HASBEEN REPORTED TO ME--I HAVE GIVEN YOUR LORDSHIP SATISFACTION IN ONETHING OR ANOTHER, I WILL MAKE A GIFT TO YOU OF MY PRESENT AND OF ALLTHAT THE FUTURE MAY BRING ME; AND IT WILL BE A GREAT PAIN TO ME TO BEUNABLE TO RECALL THE PAST, IN ORDER TO SERVE YOU SO MUCH THE LONGER,INSTEAD OF HAVING ONLY THE FUTURE, WHICH CANNOT BE LONG, SINCE I AM ALLTOO OLD. THERE IS NOTHING MORE LEFT FOR ME TO SAY. READ MY HEART ANDNOT MY LETTER, FOR MY PEN CANNOT APPROACH THE EXPRESSION OF MY GOODWILL."[ 3 ]CAVALIERI WRITES TO MICHAEL ANGELO THAT HE REGARDS HIMSELF AS BORNANEW SINCE HE HAS COME TO KNOW THE MASTER; WHO REPLIES, "I FOR MY PARTSHOULD REGARD MYSELF AS NOT BORN, BORN DEAD, OR DESERTED BY HEAVEN ANDEARTH, IF YOUR LETTERS HAD NOT BROUGHT ME THE PERSUASION THAT YOURLORDSHIP ACCEPTS WITH FAVOUR CERTAIN OF MY WORKS." AND IN A LETTER OFTHE FOLLOWING SUMMER TO SEBASTIAN DEL PIOMBO, HE SENDS A GREETING TOMESSER TOMMASO, WITH THE WORDS: "I BELIEVE _I SHOULD INSTANTLY FALLDOWN DEAD_ IF HE WERE NO LONGER IN MY THOUGHTS."[ 4 ]MICHAEL ANGELO PLAYS UPON HIS FRIEND'S SURNAME AS SHAKESPEARE PLAYSUPON HIS FRIEND'S CHRISTIAN NAME. THESE ARE THE LAST LINES OF THETHIRTY-FIRST SONNET:--   "SE VINT' E PRES' I' DEBB' ESSER BEATO,    MERAVIGLIA NON E SE, NUD' E SOLO,    RESTO PRIGION D'UN _CAVALIER_ ARMATO."    "IF ONLY CHAINS AND BANDS CAN MAKE ME BLEST,     NO MARVEL IF ALONE AND BARE I GO     AN ARMED KNIGHT'S CAPTIVE AND SLAVE CONFESSED."    (_J. A. SYMONDS_.)IN OTHER SONNETS THE TONE IS NO LESS PASSIONATE THAN SHAKESPEARE'S--TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TWENTY-SECOND:--    "MORE TENDERLY PERCHANCE THAN IS MY DUE,     YOUR SPIRIT SEES INTO MY HEART, WHERE RISE     THE FLAMES OF HOLY WORSHIP, NOR DENIES     THE GRACE RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO HUMBLY SUE.     OH BLESSED DAY WHEN YOU AT LAST ARE MINE!     LET TIME STAND STILL, AND LET NOON'S CHARIOT STAY;     FIXED BE THAT MOMENT ON THE DIAL OF HEAVEN!     THAT I MAY CLASP AND KEEP, BY GRACE DIVINE--     CLASP IN THESE YEARNING ARMS AND KEEP FOR AYE     MY HEART'S LOVED LORD TO ME DESERTLESS GIVEN."[ 5 ]                                    (_J. A. SYMONDS_.)IN COMPARISON WITH CAVALIERI, MICHAEL ANGELO COULD WITH JUSTICE CALLHIMSELF OLD. SOME CRITICS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE SEEN IN THE FACTTHAT SHAKESPEARE WAS NOT REALLY OLD AT THE TIME WHEN THE SONNETS WEREWRITTEN, A PROOF OF THEIR CONVENTIONAL AND UNREAL CHARACTER. BUT THISIS TO OVERLOOK THE RELATIVITY OF THE TERM. AS COMPARED WITH A YOUTH OFEIGHTEEN, SHAKESPEARE WAS IN EFFECT OLD, WITH HIS SIXTEEN ADDITIONALYEARS AND ALL HIS EXPERIENCE OF LIFE. AND IF WE ARE RIGHT IN ASSIGNINGSONNETS LXIII. AND LXXIII. TO THE YEAR 1600 OR 1601, SHAKESPEARE HADTHEN REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY-SEVEN, AN AGE AT WHICH (AMONG HISCONTEMPORARIES) DRAYTON IN HIS _IDEA_ DWELLS QUITE IN THE SAME SPIRITUPON THE WRINKLES OF AGE IN HIS FACE, AND AT WHICH, AS TYLER HAS VERYAPTLY POINTED OUT, BYRON IN HIS SWAN-SONG USES EXPRESSIONS ABOUTHIMSELF WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM SHAKESPEARE'S SEVENTY-THIRDSONNET. SHAKESPEARE SAYS:--    "THAT TIME OF YEAR THOU MAYST IN ME BEHOLD     WHEN _YELLOW LEAVES_, OR NONE, OR FEW, DO HANG     UPON THOSE BOUGHS WHICH SHAKE AGAINST THE COLD     BARE RUIN'D CHOIRS, WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG."BYRON THUS EXPRESSES HIMSELF:--    "MY DAYS ARE IN _THE YELLOW LEAF_,[ 6 ]       THE FLOWERS AND FRUITS OF LOVE ARE GONE,     THE WORM, THE CANKER AND THE GRIEF       ARE MINE ALONE."IN SHAKESPEARE WE READ:--    "IN ME THOU SEEST _THE GLOWING OF SUCH FIRE_     THAT ON THE ASHES OF HIS YOUTH DOTH LIE     AS THE _DEATH-BED_ WHEREON IT MUST EXPIRE,     CONSUM'D WITH THAT WHICH IT WAS NOURISH'D BY."BYRON'S WORDS ARE:--    "_THE FIRE THAT ON MY BOSOM PREYS_          IS LONE AS SOME VOLCANIC ISLE;     NO TORCH IS KINDLED AT ITS BLAZE--       _A FUNERAL PILE_"THUS BOTH POETS LIKEN THEMSELVES, AT THIS COMPARATIVELY EARLY AGE, TOTHE WINTRY WOODS WITH THEIR YELLOWING LEAVES, AND WITHOUT BLOSSOM,FRUIT, OR THE SONG OF BIRDS; AND BOTH COMPARE THE FIRE WHICH STILLGLOWS IN THEIR SOUL TO A SOLITARY FLAME WHICH FINDS NO NOURISHMENT FROMWITHOUT. THE ASHES OF MY YOUTH BECOME ITS DEATH-BED, SAYS SHAKESPEARE.THEY ARE A FUNERAL PILE, SAYS BYRON.NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE, AS SCHUCK DOES, FROM THE CONVENTIONALSTYLE OF THE FIRST SEVENTEEN SONNETS--FOR INSTANCE, FROM THEIR ALMOSTVERBAL IDENTITY WITH A PASSAGE IN SIDNEY'S _ARCADIA_--THAT THEY AREQUITE DEVOID OF RELATION TO THE POET'S OWN LIFE.IN SHORT, THE ELEMENTS OF TEMPORARY FASHION AND CONVENTION WHICH APPEARIN THE SONNETS IN NO WAY PROVE THAT THEY WERE NOT GENUINE EXPRESSIONSOF THE POET'S ACTUAL FEELINGS.THEY LAY BARE TO US A SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR INTHE PLAYS. WE SEE IN HIM AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WITH A PASSIONATE BENTTOWARDS SELF-SURRENDER IN LOVE AND IDOLATRY, AND WITH A CORRESPONDING,THOUGH LESS EXCESSIVE, YEARNING TO BE LOVED.WE LEARN FROM THE SONNETS TO WHAT A DEGREE SHAKESPEARE WAS OPPRESSEDAND TORMENTED BY HIS SENSE OF THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH THE ACTOR'S CALLINGWAS HELD. THE SCORN OF ANCIENT ROME FOR THE MOUNTEBANK, THE HORROR OFANCIENT JUDEA FOR WHOEVER DISGUISED HIMSELF IN THE GARMENTS OF THEOTHER SEX, AND FINALLY THE AGE-OLD HATRED OF CHRISTIANITY FOR THEATRESAND ALL THE TEMPTATIONS THAT FOLLOW IN THEIR TRAIN--ALL THESE HABITSOF THOUGHT HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION, AND, ASPURITANISM GREW IN STRENGTH AND GAINED THE UPPER HAND, HAD BEGOTTEN ACONTEMPTUOUS TONE OF PUBLIC OPINION UNDER WHICH SO SENSITIVE A NATUREAS SHAKESPEARE'S COULD NOT BUT SUFFER KEENLY. HE WAS NOT REGARDED ASA POET WHO NOW AND THEN ACTED, BUT AS AN ACTOR WHO NOW AND THEN WROTEPLAYS. IT WAS A PAIN TO HIM TO FEEL THAT HE BELONGED TO A CASTE WHICHHAD NO CIVIC STATUS. HENCE HIS COMPLAINT, IN SONNET XXIX., OF BEING "INDISGRACE WITH FORTUNE AND MEN'S EYES." HENCE, IN SONNET XXXVI., HISASSURANCE TO HIS FRIEND THAT HE WILL NOT OBTRUDE ON OTHERS THE FACT OFTHEIR FRIENDSHIP:--    "I MAY NOT EVERMORE ACKNOWLEDGE THEE,     LEST MY BEWAILED GUILT SHOULD DO THEE SHAME:     NOR THOU WITH PUBLIC KINDNESS HONOUR ME,     UNLESS THOU TAKE THAT HONOUR FROM THY NAME:     BUT DO NOT SO; I LOVE THEE IN SUCH SORT,     AS, THOU BEING MINE, MINE IS THY GOOD REPORT."THE BITTER COMPLAINT IN SONNET LXXII. SEEMS RATHER TO REFER TO THEWRITER'S SITUATION AS A DRAMATIST:--    "FOR I AM SHAMED BY THAT WHICH I BRING FORTH,     AND SO SHOULD YOU, TO LOVE THINGS NOTHING WORTH."THE MELANCHOLY WHICH FILLS SONNET CX. IS OCCASIONED BY THE WRITER'SPROFESSION AND HIS NATURE AS A POET AND ARTIST:--    "ALAS! 'TIS TRUE, I HAVE GONE HERE AND THERE,     AND MADE MYSELF A MOTLEY TO THE VIEW;     GOR'D MINE OWN THOUGHTS, SOLD CHEAP WHAT IS MOST DEAR,     MADE OLD OFFENCES OF AFFECTIONS NEW:     MOST TRUE IT IS, THAT I HAVE LOOK'D ON TRUTH     ASKANCE AND STRANGELY; BUT, BY ALL ABOVE,     THESE BLENCHES GAVE MY HEART ANOTHER YOUTH,     AND WORSE ESSAYS PROV'D THEE MY BEST OF LOVE."HENCE, FINALLY, HIS REPROACH TO FORTUNE, IN SONNET CXI., THAT SHE DIDNOT "BETTER FOR HIS LIFE PROVIDE THAN PUBLIC MEANS WHICH PUBLIC MANNERSBREEDS":--    "THENCE COMES IT THAT MY NAME RECEIVES A BRAND;     AND ALMOST THENCE MY NATURE IS SUBDU'D     TO WHAT IT WORKS IN, LIKE THE DYER'S HAND."WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THIS CONTINUAL WRITHING UNDER THE PREJUDICEAGAINST HIS CALLING AND HIS ART, AND THIS INDIGNATION AT THE INJUSTICEOF THE ATTITUDE ADOPTED TOWARDS THEM BY A GREAT PART OF THE MIDDLECLASSES, IF WE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE HIGH PRESSURE OF SHAKESPEARE'SFEELINGS TOWARDS THE NOBLE YOUTH WHO HAD APPROACHED HIM FULL OF THEART-LOVING TRADITIONS OF THE ARISTOCRACY, AND THE BURNING ENTHUSIASMOF THE YOUNG FOR INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY. WILLIAM HERBERT, WITH HISBEAUTY AND HIS PERSONAL CHARM, MUST HAVE COME TO HIM LIKE A VERY ANGELOF LIGHT, A MESSENGER FROM A HIGHER WORLD THAN THAT IN WHICH HIS LOTWAS CAST. HE WAS A LIVING WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS NOTCONDEMNED TO SEEK THE APPLAUSE OF THE MULTITUDE ALONE, BUT COULD WINTHE FAVOUR OF THE NOBLEST IN THE LAND, AND WAS NOT EXCLUDED FROM A DEEPAND ALMOST PASSIONATE FRIENDSHIP WHICH PLACED HIM ON AN EQUAL FOOTINGWITH THE BEARER OF AN ANCIENT NAME. PEMBROKE'S GREAT BEAUTY NO DOUBTMADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON THE BEAUTY-LOVER IN SHAKESPEARE'S SOUL.IT IS VERY PROBABLE, TOO, THAT THE YOUNG ARISTOCRAT, ACCORDING TO THEFASHION OF THE TIMES, MADE THE POET HIS DEBTOR FOR SOLIDER BENEFACTIONSTHAN MERE FRIENDSHIP; AND SHAKESPEARE MUST THUS HAVE FELT DOUBLYPAINFUL THE SITUATION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED BY THE INTRIGUE BETWEENHIS MISTRESS AND HIS FRIEND.[ 7 ].IN ANY CASE, THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH PEMBROKE INSPIREDSHAKESPEARE--THE PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT, LEADING EVEN TO JEALOUSY OFOTHER POETS ADMIRED BY THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN--HAD NOT ONLY A VIVIDNESS,BUT AN EROTIC FERVOUR SUCH AS WE NEVER FIND IN OUR CENTURY MANIFESTEDBETWEEN MAN AND MAN. NOTE SUCH AN EXPRESSION AS THIS IN SONNET CX.:--    "THEN GIVE ME WELCOME, NEXT MY HEAVEN THE BEST,     EVEN TO THY PURE AND MOST MOST LOVING BREAST."THIS EXACTLY CORRESPONDS TO MICHAEL ANGELO'S RECENTLY-QUOTED DESIRE TO"CLASP IN HIS YEARNING ARMS HIS HEART'S LOVED LORD." OR OBSERVE SUCH ALINE AS THIS IN SONNET LXXV.:--    "SO ARE YOU TO MY THOUGHTS AS FOOD TO LIFE."WE HAVE HERE AN EXACT COUNTERPART TO THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSIONS IN ALETTER FROM MICHAEL ANGELO TO CAVALIERI, DATED JULY 1533 : "I WOULD FARRATHER FORGET THE FOOD ON WHICH I LIVE, WHICH WRETCHEDLY SUSTAINS THEBODY ALONE, THAN YOUR NAME, WHICH SUSTAINS BOTH BODY AND SOUL, FILLINGBOTH WITH SUCH HAPPINESS THAT I CAN FEEL NEITHER CARE NOR FEAR OF DEATHWHILE I HAVE IT IN MY MEMORY."[ 8 ]THE PASSIONATE FERVOUR OF THIS FRIENDSHIP ON THE PLATONIC MODEL ISACCOMPANIED IN SHAKESPEARE, AS IN MICHAEL ANGELO, BY A SUBMISSIVENESSON THE PART OF THE ELDER FRIEND TOWARDS THE YOUNGER, WHICH, IN THESETWO SUPREME GENIUSES, AFFECTS THE MODERN READER PAINFULLY. EACH HAD PUTOFF EVERY SHRED OF PRIDE IN RELATION TO HIS IDOLISED YOUNG FRIEND. HOWSTRANGE IT SEEMS TO FIND SHAKESPEARE CALLING HIMSELF YOUNG HERBERT'S"SLAVE," AND ASSURING HIM THAT HIS TIME, MORE PRECIOUS THAN THAT OFANY OTHER MAN THEN LIVING, IS OF NO VALUE, SO THAT HIS FRIEND MAY LETHIM WAIT OR SUMMON HIM TO HIS SIDE AS HIS CAPRICE AND FANCY DICTATE.IN SONNET LVIII. HE SPEAKS OF "THAT GOD WHO MADE ME FIRST YOUR SLAVE."SONNET LVII. RUNS THUS:--    "BEING _YOUR SLAVE_, WHAT SHOULD I DO BUT TEND     UPON THE HOURS AND TIMES OF YOUR DESIRE?     I HAVE NO PRECIOUS TIME AT ALL TO SPEND,     NOR SERVICES TO DO, TILL YOU REQUIRE.     NOR DARE I CHIDE THE WORLD-WITHOUT-END HOUR,     WHILST I, MY SOVEREIGN, WATCH THE CLOCK FOR YOU,     NOR THINK THE BITTERNESS OF ABSENCE SOUR,     WHEN YOU HAVE BID YOUR SERVANT ONCE ADIEU;     NOR DARE I QUESTION WITH MY JEALOUS THOUGHT,     WHERE YOU MAY BE, OR YOUR AFFAIRS SUPPOSE;     BUT, LIKE A SAD SLAVE, STAY AND THINK OF NOUGHT,     SAVE, WHERE YOU ARE HOW HAPPY YOU MAKE THOSE."JUST AS MICHAEL ANGELO SPOKE TO CAVALIERI OF HIS WORKS AS THOUGHTHEY WERE SCARCELY WORTH HIS FRIEND'S NOTICE, SO DOES SHAKESPEARESOMETIMES SPEAK OF HIS VERSES. IN SONNET XXXII. HE BEGS HIS FRIENDS TO"RE-SURVEY" THEM WHEN HE IS DEAD:--    "AND THOUGH THEY BE OUTSTRIPP'D BY EVERY PEN,     RESERVE THEM FOR MY LOVE, NOT FOR THEIR RHYME,     EXCEEDED BY THE HEIGHT OF HAPPIER MEN."THIS HUMILITY BECOMES QUITE DESPICABLE WHEN A BREACH IS THREATENEDBETWEEN THE FRIENDS. SHAKESPEARE THEN REPEATEDLY PROMISES SO TO BLACKENHIMSELF THAT HIS FRIEND SHALL REAP, NOT SHAME, BUT HONOUR, FROM HISFAITHLESSNESS. IN SONNET LXXXVIII.:--    "WITH MINE OWN WEAKNESS BEING BEST ACQUAINTED,     UPON THY PART I CAN SET DOWN A STORY     OF FAULTS CONCEALED WHEREIN I AM ATTAINTED,     THAT THOU, IN LOSING ME, SHALT WIN MUCH GLORY."SONNET LXXXIX. IS STILL MORE STRONGLY WORDED:--    "THOU CANST NOT, LOVE, DISGRACE ME HALF SO ILL,     TO SET A FORM UPON DESIRED CHANGE,     AS I'LL MYSELF DISGRACE: KNOWING THY WILL,     I WILL ACQUAINTANCE STRANGLE, AND LOOK STRANGE;     BE ABSENT FROM THY WALKS; AND IN MY TONGUE     THY SWEET-BELOVED NAME NO MORE SHALL DWELL,     LEST I (TOO MUCH PROFANE) SHOULD DO IT WRONG,     AND HAPLY OF OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE TELL.        FOR THEE, AGAINST MYSELF I'LL VOW DEBATE,        FOR I MUST NE'ER LOVE HIM WHOM THOU DOST HATE."WE ARE POSITIVELY SURPRISED WHEN, IN A SINGLE PASSAGE, IN SONNET LXII.,WE COME UPON A FORCIBLE EXPRESSION OF SELF-LOVE; BUT IT DOES NOT EXTENDBEYOND THE FIRST HALF OF THE SONNET; IN THE SECOND HALF THIS SELF-LOVEIS ALREADY REGARDED AS A SIN, AND SHAKESPEARE HUMBLY EFFACES HIMSELFBEFORE HIS FRIEND. ALL THE MORE GLADLY DOES THE READER WELCOME THE FEWSONNETS (LV. AND LXXXI.) IN WHICH THE POET CONFIDENTLY PREDICTS THEIMMORTALITY OF THESE HIS UTTERANCES. IT IS TRUE THAT SHAKESPEARE ISHERE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY ANTIQUITY AND BY THE FASHION OF HIS AGE;AND IT IS SIMPLY AS RECORDS OF HIS FRIEND'S BEAUTY AND AMIABILITY THATHIS VERSES ARE TO BE PRESERVED THROUGH ALL AGES TO COME. BUT NO POETWITHOUT A SOUND AND VIGOROUS SELF-CONFIDENCE COULD HAVE WRITTEN EITHERTHESE LINES IN SONNET LV.:--
